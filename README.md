# Retail Sales & Transaction Analysis — SQL Project




## 📋 Overview
This project performs comprehensive analysis of a retail transaction dataset using SQL. The goal is to extract actionable business insights around customer behavior, product performance, revenue generation, and returns across various categories and time periods.

The dataset covers details of customer transactions including product categories, subcategories, rates, quantities sold, store types, and customer demographics.
## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three main tables:

* Transactions: Contains details of individual transactions including transaction date, product category, rate, quantity, total amount, and store type.

* Product Category Info: Provides mapping of product category codes and subcategory names.

* Customer: Includes customer demographic details like customer ID, gender, date of birth, and city code.
## 🎯 Project Objectives
* Analyze revenue generation by product category, subcategory, and gender.

* Calculate total sales and returns by subcategory.

* Identify top-performing subcategories based on revenue.

* Track customer transaction behavior over time.

* Determine average revenue by product category and compare it to the overall average.

* Derive business-ready KPIs using SQL queries.
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* SQL Server

* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

* SQL Queries (Aggregation, Joins, Filtering, Grouping, Date Functions)
